1) Run VS as Administrator to get uploaded Web Projects (wich have Web.Config and may be deployed on WebSite or locally into folder).
2) Deployment has been tested locally on "Local IIS" and on free hosting Somee.com
3) Domain (Name of the root site) on Somee.com - vizdr.somee.com
4) Deploy and convert to application two web-projects WcfServARR and WcfSer4. Be careful with rename, because these names are saved in Web.Config and settings.
5) UserName and Pwd for WebProjects  are saved in WebConfig, UserName and Pwd for SQL-Db are generated by Somee after DB creating.
6) Replace the generated by Somee part of connectionString in Web.Config 
7) Empty DB should be generated on Somee. Afterwards detach WcfUsersDB from the local SQL Express Server and make from the detached mdf and ldf files zip to upload on Somee. Attach both files on Somee to the DB.
